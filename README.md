# SaturnOS, the very simple one

My personal project for OS development. 

## Changelog

18.3.2018 - Initial commit, simple bootloader (which took most of the 
time, and simple kernel which uses the VGA compatible text mode to 
write data to the screen.)

## Build instructions

` # ./build_and_run run `
